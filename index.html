        <p class="about-p">My name is Stephen Talbot, and I am a full-stack software developer located in Austin, Texas 
            with a focus in back-end / full-stack development. My passion for making the world a better place through STEM 
            derives from my background in Chemistry, while my unrelenting drive for success comes from my experience in the US Army</p>
        <p class="about-p">As a recent graduate from <a href="https://codeup.com/" class="about-a">Codeup</a>,
            I am eager to explore the vast realm of software development. With the constant changes in technology,
            keeping current with new/updated languages, libraries, frameworks is crucial for my success as a developer.
            By working on personal projects, refining my current skill set, and expanding my knowledge base I
            am able to efficiently utilize many tools</p>
        <!--        <p class="about-p">I am keen and preferential to back-end development. My love for back-end development-->
        <!--            flourished when I was able to incorporate <a href="https://spring.io/" class="about-a">Spring Boot</a> into-->
        <!--            my most recent full-stack project. Although I prefer back-end development, I have maintained my front-end-->

                    <p><a href="https://codeup.com/" class="about-a">Codeup</a> has played an integral role in nurturing
                        my love for software development. I have spent these 5 months learning the basics of full-stack
                        development from the ground up. To list a few of the things that I have learned
                        include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaSE, JavaEE, MySQL, Spring Boot, and more. The
                        curriculum has provided me with an opportunity to learn and apply these multiple languages and
                        frameworks. This bootcamp has brought back my love for problem-solving and critical thinking,
                        and has helped me think about the technological world in a different way

                    <p>Tether is a full-stack web application that is similar to a social media site. Having 2.5 weeks
                        to build this application from start to finish, it has a plethora of user functionality. My
                        front-end contributions include most of the styling that you see, redirect messages, TalkJS API,
                        MapBox API, and password verification. My back-end contributions include most of the MySQL DB
                        queries, friend requests, group requests, and security. It is currently only desktop-ready for
                        large screens. Click on the link above to check out the live site, or contact me below to find

                    <p>Sep 2017 - Current</p>
                    <p>From 2017 - 2021 I served in the US Army as an active duty Infantryman. Maintaining the same job
                        title, I switched over from active duty to the Texas Army National Guard in early 2021. In my 6
                        years, the US Army has molded me and prepared me for the software development workforce by
                        providing me with opportunities to lead and to showcase my ability to create cohesive teams. It
                        has cultivated drive and work ethic within me that I will hold onto forever. I would not be half
                        of the software developer that I am today if it was not for the grit that the US Army has
                        instilled in me</p>
