        <p class="about-p">My name is Stephen Talbot, and I am a full-stack software developer with a focus in back-end
            development. My passion for making the world a better place through STEM derives from my background in
            Chemistry, while my unrelenting drive for success comes from my experience in the US Army</p>
        <p class="about-p">As a recent graduate from <a href="https://codeup.com/" class="about-a">Codeup</a>,
            I am eager to explore the vast realm of software development. With the constant changes in technology,
            keeping current with new/updated languages, libraries, frameworks is crucial for my success as a developer.
            By working on personal projects, refining my current skill set, and expanding my knowledge base I
            am able to efficiently utilize many tools</p>
        <!--        <p class="about-p">I am keen and preferential to back-end development. My love for back-end development-->
        <!--            flourished when I was able to incorporate <a href="https://spring.io/" class="about-a">Spring Boot</a> into-->
        <!--            my most recent full-stack project. Although I prefer back-end development, I have maintained my front-end-->
        <!--            skill set so that I am to create full-stack web applications.</p>-->
        <p class="about-p">If you're looking for a reliable developer that will enhance your teams' success, a developer
            that wants to collaborate, or you'd just like to stop by and say hello, please feel free to

                    <p>Nov 2022 - May 2023</p>
                    <p><a href="https://codeup.com/" class="about-a">Codeup</a> has played an integral role in nurturing
                        my love for software development. I have spent these 5 months learning the basics of full-stack
                        development from the ground up, as I have no prior experience in this field other than this
                        bootcamp. The curriculum provided has provided me with an opportunity to learn and apply
                        multiple languages and frameworks. This bootcamp has brought back my love for problem-solving
                        and critical thinking, and has helped me think about the technological world in a different way

                    <p>Tether is a full-stack web application that is similar to a social media site. Having 2.5 weeks
                        to build this application from start to finish, it has a plethora of user functionality. For
                        this capstone project, I am proud to say that I had contributed significantly on the back-end as
                        well as taking on a good chunk of the front-end work for this project. It is currently only
                        desktop-ready for large screens. Click on the link above to check out the live site</p>

                    <p>Sep 2017 - Current</p>
                    <p>From 2017 - 2021 I served in the US Army as an active duty Infantryman. Maintaining the same job
                        title, I switched over from active duty to the Texas Army National Guard in early 2021. In my 6
                        years, the US Army has molded me and prepared me for the software development workforce by
                        providing me with opportunities to lead and to showcase my ability to create cohesive teams. I
                        would not be half of the software developer that I am today if it was not for the grit that the
                        US Army had instilled in me</p>
